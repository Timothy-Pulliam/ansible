# This Ansible playbook is for building an authoritative DNS
# server. Recursion is disabled. Also, named listens on all IP
# interfaces. This is not a secure server.

# Usage: The only thing you should have to do is fill in the variables below.
# The playbook will configure the /etc/named.conf file. It will also add zones
# based on the zone information provided in the variable section below.
